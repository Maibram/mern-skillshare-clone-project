## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- npm or yarn
- A local MongoDB instance (using MongoDB Compass) or a MongoDB Atlas account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Maibram/mern-skillshare-clone-project.git](https://github.com/Maibram/mern-skillshare-clone-project.git)
    ```
2.  **Install Backend Dependencies**
    ```sh
    cd mern-skillshare-project/backend
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Before you can run the backend, you need to create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (or the template below) into a new file named `.env` and fill in your secret keys.


backend/.env
Server Configuration
PORT=5000

Database Configuration (replace with your MongoDB connection string)
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/skillshare

JWT Configuration (use a long, random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

Email Configuration (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY
EMAIL_FROM=your_verified_email@example.com

Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET


### Running the Application

1.  **Run the Backend Server** (from the `backend` folder)
    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```
2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server** (from the `frontend` folder, in a new terminal)
    ```sh
    npm run dev 
    ```
    Your application should now be running, with the frontend at `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite port) and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.
